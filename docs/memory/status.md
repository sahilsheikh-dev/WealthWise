# Status

- Current task: P29-L Insurance implementation and migration are complete.
  Home was inspected read-only: it imports only `policySummary`
  for its Insurance box and generic pending dues for Upcoming and due; it does
  not depend on cover goals. `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` remains user-owned and was
  not edited.
- Phase 29 status: P29-A through P29-L are Done.
  Includes P29-F2, P29-F3 and
  P29-F4. DEC-P29E-HOLDING-DELETE withdraws Undo after holding deletion; the
  retained same-write Budget unlink requirement is proven.
- Schema version: v17. P29-L removes the retired coverGoals and policy
  coverGoalId data; migrations/backups through v16 remain supported.
- Runtime: Node.js 26.13.0.
- Test counts: 86 suites, 1086 tests.
  Latest validated run: 86 suites, 1086 tests passed with
  `npm test -- --coverage` on 2026-11-03.
- All six P29-L gates exit 0: Jest coverage, TypeScript, Expo lint with zero
  warnings, Expo Doctor 21/21, Android export and iOS export. Exact commands
  and exit codes are in [PROGRESS.md](../PROGRESS.md).
- Fresh P29-L coverage was generated after deleting the prior
  `coverage/coverage-final.json`, then measured from the regenerated file with
  `istanbul-lib-coverage`: files were grouped by immediate `src/` directory;
  line coverage counts executable source lines and branch coverage counts
  branch arms. `src/data`: 660/699 lines (94.42%), 700/795 branches (88.05%);
  `src/domain`: 3186/3236 lines (98.45%), 3132/3363 branches (93.13%);
  `src/lib`: 107/107 lines and 126/126 branches (100%). Per-file branch
  coverage: `src/domain/budget.ts` 770/849 (90.69%) and
  `src/data/createAppStore.ts` 73/84 (86.90%); configured thresholds of 90%
  and 85% are satisfied.
- `npx expo lint` exits 0 with zero warnings and no eslint-disable comments
  added.
- The P29-K assertion audit compares `d8af3f5` with the final worktree:
  630 to 651 `expect(` occurrences (+21, -0, net +21) across four changed
  test files. The two updated memory/ledger expectation values are documented
  as data/count replacements in [PROGRESS.md](../PROGRESS.md); no assertion
  was weakened.
- The P29-F4 assertion audit compares 531d659 with its audited worktree:
  2050 to 2184 `expect(` occurrences (+134); 41 removed expectation lines are
  documented replacements, not removed-only assertions.
- The P29-J final assertion audit compares 337fcc5 with HEAD: the two changed
  test files remain at 169 total `expect(` occurrences (0 added, 0 removed,
  0 net); the modified expected ledger counts and P29-J coverage are recorded
  in [PROGRESS.md](../PROGRESS.md).
- The P29-L assertion audit compares inventory commit `8255857` with the final
  task changes: 2513 to 2430 `expect(` occurrences (18 added, 101 removed,
  net -83) across the changed test files. All removed/replaced assertions and
  reasons are listed in [PROGRESS.md](../PROGRESS.md).
- The prior Gate 1 timeout output is unavailable and cannot be quoted. The
  final fresh full run passes; see the ledger for the historical isolated-run
  information and the preliminary TypeScript correction.
- Coverage and UI tests are simulated. See [open-items.md](open-items.md) for
  physical-device checks not verified.
- Encrypted backups protect exported files only. On-device data remains
  unencrypted; app lock is not encryption. A lost passphrase is unrecoverable.
- The ledger at [`docs/PROGRESS.md`](../PROGRESS.md) is the source of truth
  for decisions, status, acceptance evidence, gates and device checks.
